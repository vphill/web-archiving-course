## Overview

This course is divided into [modules](./modules/) that are designed to build sequentally throughout the course.

There are fourteen modules in total starting the first week of class and ending the last week of the semester. 

Each week there is an **_Overview and Objectives_** section which gives students an idea of what is going to be happening in that week's module. 

The **_Readings_** page will list the required and optional readings for that week.  In addition to traditional readings, there are videos and sometimes audio recordings for students to listen to. 

A feature of each module called _**Exploring Web Archives**_ is included to give students a bit of a guided introduction to the wide range of web archives and collections that exist around the world. These explorations are generally a part of the weekly discussion. 

Finally, in each module there is a **_Discussion_** related to the topics covered that week. Additionally, the web archives the students explored in the Exploring Web Archives section will come back as part of the weekly discussion.

Generally the current week's module and the following week's module will get published for students that like to work a bit ahead.  The graded discussions are opened on Monday morning of the module week. 

In addition to weekly readings, activities, and discussions, there are four major [assignments](./assignments/) spread across the semester. The final assignment is informed by the third assignment.
